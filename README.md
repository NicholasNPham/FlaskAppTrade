----------------------------------------------------
Creating a website with a username/password functionality that enables register and login. The page will lead into a home page where to will lead to a Information Page and a Input Page.
The Input Page will allow forms for user input to enter in data of a specific stock/forex/crypto and return an analysis that is based on TradingView_TA framework and my own Analysis. 
The Info Page will support a website within the flask application using iFrame HTML. (Work In Progress, Needing Research)
